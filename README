This is the code for my Java assignments which involved creating a building management system.

Assignment 1 was mostly backend. I received 45/50 for functionality.

Assignment 2 was backend and testing, as well as integrating with UI. I received 43/45 for functionality and 14/20 for tests.

Any code that isn't marked as 'given' was written by myself.
